# A comment, this is so you can read your program later.
# Anything after the # is ignored by python.
a = 2
print  ("I could have code like this.测试拷贝中文到这里。",a )# and the comment after is ignored
# Pay attention that: In Python3 ,print() is a kind of "hanshu",don't forget the (),but in python2 the print do not need the ().
# You can also use a comment to "disable" or coment out a piece of code:

# print "This won't run."
print("This will run.")
# I also try no "space" between the Print and the(),look what happend.

# Log：
# 1.1 the chinese character could in the code，but it should in the ""，not the out line 。
